# rindex
Rindex: dynamic spatial index for efficiently maintaining *k* nearest neighbors graph of multi-dimensional clustered datasets.

## Features
Rindex supports spatial indexing operations while also maintaining k nearest neighbor information for dynamic data:
- Insertion and deletion
- Query within radius
- Query *k* nearest neighbors
- Query *reverse k* nearest neighbors
- Maintain *k* nearest neighbor graph.

Please refer to the example usage [here](https://github.com/azizkayumov/rindex/tree/main/lib) or [demo](https://github.com/azizkayumov/rindex/tree/main/demo) application with visualization.
